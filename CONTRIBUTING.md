# Contributing to GlyphX

Thanks for taking the time to help out! This guide covers how to get GlyphX
running on your machine and how to send a change our way. Bug reports, feature
ideas, docs fixes, and pull requests are all welcome.

## Ways to contribute

- **Found a bug or have an idea?** Open an [issue](https://github.com/kanakkholwal/glyphx/issues) — a clear description and steps to reproduce go a long way.
- **Want to write code?** Comment on the issue you'd like to take (or open one first for anything non-trivial), then send a pull request. Small, focused PRs are easiest to review.
- **Docs and copy** count too — typos, unclear wording, and missing setup steps are all fair game.

## Project layout

GlyphX is a monorepo with a shared UI used by both a web app and a desktop app:

```
glyph-mvp/
├── apps/
│   ├── web/        The browser editor + marketing site
│   └── desktop/    The native desktop app (a web UI wrapped in a Tauri shell)
│       └── src-tauri/   The Rust side of the desktop app
└── packages/
    ├── ui/         Shared components and the design system
    └── design/     Design tokens and assets
```

The same editor runs in both places — the web app serves it in the browser, and
the desktop app runs it locally inside a native window.

## Prerequisites

You'll need:

- **[Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) 22 or newer**
- **[pnpm](https://pnpm.io/installation) 10+** — the package manager this repo uses (`npm install -g pnpm`)

Only needed if you're working on the **desktop app** (the Tauri/Rust side):

- **[Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install)** (stable toolchain, via `rustup`)
- **Tauri's system dependencies** for your OS — follow the [Tauri prerequisites guide](https://v2.tauri.app/start/prerequisites/) (on Windows that's the Microsoft C++ Build Tools and WebView2; macOS needs Xcode Command Line Tools; Linux needs a few `webkit2gtk` packages).

You can work on the **web app and shared UI without Rust** — skip the Tauri bits.

## Getting set up

```bash
git clone https://github.com/kanakkholwal/glyphx.git
cd glyph
pnpm install        # installs everything across the monorepo
```

## Running it

```bash
# The browser editor + site  → http://localhost:5173
pnpm dev:web

# The desktop app in a native window (needs the Rust prerequisites)
pnpm dev:desktop

# Everything at once
pnpm dev
```

## Before you open a pull request

Please run these and make sure they pass:

```bash
pnpm check          # type-checking across the project
pnpm lint           # linting
pnpm format         # auto-format your changes
```

If you touched the Rust side of the desktop app, also run:

```bash
pnpm lint:rust                              # clippy
pnpm --filter @glyphx/desktop test:rust     # Rust unit tests
```

## Pull request guidelines

- **Branch** off `main` and keep each PR focused on one thing.
- **Describe the change** — what it does and why. Screenshots help for anything visual.
- **Keep the style consistent** — match the code and design conventions already in the file you're editing; the formatters and linters above will catch most of it.
- **Link the issue** your PR addresses, if there is one.
