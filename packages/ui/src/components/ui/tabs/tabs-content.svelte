<!--
	A subtle slide+fade plays whenever a panel becomes active. Driven by
	`data-state="active"` rather than Svelte's `transition:` so it survives
	bits-ui's mount/unmount cycle (svelte `out:` directives don't fire
	reliably inside `Tabs.Content` because the panel is conditionally
	rendered as a sibling, not a child of `{#if}`).

	tw-animate-css supplies `animate-in`, `fade-in-*`, `slide-in-from-*`,
	and the `duration-*` utility. Keep this short (160ms) — tabs are a
	cheap navigation, not a hero transition.
